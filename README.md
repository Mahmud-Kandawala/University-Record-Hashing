# University Record Hashing

## Asignment

The university registrar uses hash tables to find student records quickly.  It is a small university with about 4000 students. Write a  program for hashing (use either chaining or probing) to save the records in. Have a menu with the following options:
```
1.	Add a new student number to the hash table 
2.	Print out the hash table
3.	Find a studentâ€™s record using his/her number
4.	(optional) Delete a student record (careful if you use probing!)
5.	Exit
```

## Development

The code was developed using Python.

## Testing 

The test for this project is in `record.py`. The test will run automatically when you hit the "Run" button.
